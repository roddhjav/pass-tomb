.SH NAME
pass tomb - A \fBpass\fP(1) extension that helps to keep the whole tree of
password encrypted inside a \fBtomb\fP(1).

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpass tomb\fP gpgid.. [args]
.br
\fBpass open\fP
.br
\fBpass close\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
Due to the structure of \fBpass\fP(1), file- and directory names are not encrypted
in the password store. \fBpass tomb\fP provides a convenient solution to put your
password store in a \fBtomb\fP(1) and then keep your password tree encrypted
when you are not using it.

It uses the same GPG key to encrypt passwords and tomb.

.TP
.B The new workflow is the following:
.IP
1. Create a password tomb with \fBpass tomb\fP. It creates a new tomb and opens it
in ~/.password-store. Then it initialises the password repository with the same
GPG key.
.IP
2. Use tomb as usual.
.IP
3. When finished close the password tomb: \fBpass close\fP.
.IP
4. To use pass again, you need to open the password tomb: \fBpass open\fP.


.SH COMMAND

.TP
\fBpass tomb\fP [ \fI--path=subfolder\fP, \fI-p subfolder\fP ] [ \fI--no-init\fP, \fI-n\fP ] \fIgpg-id...\fP
Create and initialise a new password tomb. Use
.I gpg-id
for encryption of both passwords and tomb. Multiple gpg-ids may be specified,
in order to encrypt the tomb and each password with multiple ids. This command
must be run first, before a password store can be used. Note that use of
.BR gpg-agent (1)
is recommended so that the batch decryption does not require as much user
intervention. If \fI--path\fP or \fI-p\fP is specified, along with an argument,
a specific password tomb using gpg-id or a set of gpg-ids is assigned for that
specific subfolder of the password store. If \fI--no-init\fP, \fI-n\fP is
specified, do not initialise the password store. By default, pass-tomb
initialises the password store with the same key(s) it generated the tomb. The
purpose of this option is to let the user free to initialise the password store
with a different key or set of keys.
