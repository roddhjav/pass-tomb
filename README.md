# pass tomb [![build status][build-img]][build-url]

A [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) extension allowing you to put and
manage your password store in a tomb.

## Description

Due to the structure of `pass`, file- and directory names are not encrypted in
the password store. `pass-tomb` provides a convenient solution to put your password
store in a [tomb](https://github.com/dyne/Tomb) and then keep your password
tree encrypted when you are not using it.

It uses the same GPG key to encrypt passwords and tomb.

The new workflow is the following:
* Create a password tomb with `pass tomb`
 - Create a new tomb and open it in `~/.password-store`
 - Initialise the password store with the same GPG key
* Use tomb as usual
* When finished, close the password tomb: `pass close`
* To use pass again, you need to open the password tomb: `pass open`

## Examples

**Create a new password tomb**
```
$ pass tomb <gpg-id>
 (*) Your password tomb has been created and opened in ~/.password-store.
 (*) Password store initialized for <gpg-id>
  .  Your tomb is: ~/password
  .  Your tomb key is: ~/password.key
  .  You can now use pass as usual
  .  When finished, close the password tomb using 'pass close'
```

**Open a password tomb**
```
$ pass open
 (*) Your password tomb has been opened in ~/.password-store.
  .  You can now use pass as usual.
  .  When finished, close the password tomb using 'pass close'.
```

**Close a password tomb**
```
$ pass close
 (*) Your password tomb has been closed.
  .  Your passwords remain present in ~/password.
  ```

## Environment Variables

* `PASSWORD_STORE_TOMB`: path to `tomb` executable
* `PASSWORD_STORE_TOMB_FILE`: path to the password tomb (default: `~/password`)
* `PASSWORD_STORE_TOMB_KEY`: path to the password tomb key file (default: `~/password.key`)
* `PASSWORD_STORE_TOMB_SIZE`: password tomb size in MB (default: `10`)

## Installation

**ArchLinux**

		pacaur -S pass-tomb

**Other linuxes**

		git clone https://gitlab.com/roddhjav/pass-tomb/
		cd pass-tomb
		sudo make install

* `tomb` with GnuPG Key Support. Currently unreleased. Therefore you need to install it by hand:

		git clone https://github.com/dyne/Tomb.git
		cd Tomb
		sudo make install

* `pass 1.7.0` or greater.

* If you do not want to install this extension as system extension, you need to
enable user extension with `PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=true pass`. You can
create an alias in `.bashrc`: `alias pass='PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=true pass'`
